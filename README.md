# PyBer_Analysis
Module5

## Overview
PyBer has requested an analysis of ride-sharing data for rural, suburban, and urban cities. The supplied data was analysed using Python and Jupyter Notebook to help PyBer make business decisions. Key functions included `pd.merge()` and `resample()`. 

## Results
Referencing the below DataFrame, it's easy to see that while the volume of rides and available drivers increases as customers get closer to the city, the cost of the fares also decrease. Another thing to note is the ratio of drivers to rides in both rural and suburban cities, on high volume days there are likely not enough drivers.

The below chart shows the summarized data from January through April. This data suggests a peak time in late February (likely St Patricks Day) and also shows an upward trend of rides in the suburban cities as the weather gets warmer.

## Summary
Based on the above data, I would make the following suggestions to optimize revenue:
- Advertise the rate differences to urban drivers, encouraging them to venture toward suburban and rural areas for higher fares.
- Try a promotion in suburban and rural areas to attract more riders. For example, a ride-share "happy hour" with a discounted fare.
- Consider integrating food delivery into the PyBer business model in an effort to diversify revenue during slower months.
